# (Indian) Real Estate RWA Stablecoin Ecosystem: Market, Financial Flow & Operational Model

This document outlines a comprehensive financial flow diagram for a Real World Asset (RWA) tokenization model based on a portfolio of 100 real estate properties located in India. The model uniquely integrates an asset-backed stablecoin for capital liquidity with a separate yield-bearing token for income distribution.

### Financial Flow Diagram

The following Mermaid diagram illustrates the lifecycle of assets, token issuance, fund allocation, and investor interactions within the primary and secondary markets.

Detailed Narrative Description

The flowchart above is structured into several key layers: Core Assets, Issuance Mechanisms, Token Products, Markets/Pools, and Participants.

1. Core Asset Foundation (Blue Block)

The entire ecosystem is built upon the foundation of [100 Indian Properties], which includes a mix of income-generating rental properties and self-use properties.

2. Dual-Track Token Issuance Mechanism

The model ingeniously separates the "capital value" and the "yield value" of the properties into two distinct tracks:

    Left Track - Stablecoin (Capital Value): The total property portfolio serves as collateral. It undergoes (Quarterly Valuation & Monitoring) to ensure the asset value always exceeds the issued tokens. Based on this valuation, the [Property Stablecoin] is created via {Collateralized Issuance} at a 50% Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratio, pegging its value to the Indian Rupee (INR).

    Right Track - RWA Token (Yield Value): The (Rental Income Stream) generated specifically by the rental properties within the portfolio is used to back the issuance of the [10-Year Property Yield RWA Token]. Holding this token represents a right to share in the rental dividends over the next decade.

3. Primary Market & Fund Allocation (Green & Purple Blocks)

    Investors enter the [Primary Market] bringing external capital (fiat or cryptocurrency).

    They deploy these funds to acquire the [Property Stablecoin].

    Critical Fund Flow: The proceeds received from stablecoin issuance are split in the backend. 25% is allocated to the [INR Liquidity Pool] to serve as a reserve for future redemptions, while the remaining 75% is utilized by the issuer.

4. Secondary Market & DeFi Interaction (Green Blocks)

    Trading Medium: The [Property Stablecoin] functions as the native currency for transactions within this ecosystem.

    RWA Trading: The [10-Year RWA Token] is listed on the [Secondary Market]. Investors wishing to buy or sell this yield token must use the [Property Stablecoin] for settlement. Unlike the stablecoin, the price of the RWA Token is not fixed but determined freely by market supply and demand.

    DeFi Enhancement: Investors can further utilize their Stablecoins or RWA Tokens within various [DeFi Protocols], engaging in activities such as Staking to earn additional yields or performing leveraged lending operations.

5. Redemption Mechanism

    When investors wish to exit their stablecoin positions, the [INR Liquidity Pool] is utilized to facilitate these requests, enabling the redemption of the stablecoin back into fiat or other base assets.
